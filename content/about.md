Let's be honest, I don't have any answer any of the questions I stated in the description. This site exists because I own the domain and haven't got the heart to leave it empty/erroring out. I sometimes write in it. But most often I say "fuhgedaboutidall" and burn it to its cinders, salt the ground and throw a nuke just to make it a proper scorched earth. 

*sigh*

I am just a regular guy who is into:

- Philosophy
- Sociology
- International Relations
- Cybersecurity
- Data wrangling
- Gaming
- Science Fiction (but not Fantasy nowadays)
- Synthwave
- Russian Language
- ...
